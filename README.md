# guessing-game
An "About Me" guessing game that asks the user yes/no questions about me (Hannah Sindorf) and gives a response based on whether or not the user is correct.

## Observations
- Silly syntax errors break everything
- My actual code didn't follow the same logic as my pseudocode
- it was easy to do all five questions once I wrote one
