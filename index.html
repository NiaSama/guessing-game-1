      <p>Yes! A little too much!</p> 
      <h3>Did I study computer science in college?</h3>
      <p>No! I studied linguistics. Some parts of it are very technical, but it's not quite computer science.</p>
      <h3>Do I speak more than one language?</h3>
      <p>Yes! My minor was Japanese, so I speak it fairly well. I also studied a year of Hebrew, but forgot a lot of it.</p>
      <h3>Is my favorite food curry?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I could eat it every day.</p>
